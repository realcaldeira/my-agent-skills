# Staging instead of stating (1–5)

These are the most frequent tells in current model prose and sit in the
*forte* tier: act on one sighting. Shared rules (voice matching, fact preservation, when not to act)
live in `references/voice-and-guardrails.md`; read that file first.

## 1. Not X but Y

**Source:** [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing] · [blader/humanizer]

**Watch for:** not X but Y; not just, not only, or not merely X, but Y; it's not X, it's Y; the reversed form X rather than Y; the same contrast split across sentences ("This does not mean X. It means Y."); a clipped negative tail ("..., no guessing"). The formula appears in every language; treat the equivalent construction the same way.
**Problem:** The negative half names something no one claimed, so the positive half sounds larger. It adds weight without adding a claim. State the point directly. Keep a contrast only when the negative half corrects a belief the reader actually holds, or when both halves carry information.
**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.
**After:**
> The beat under the vocals adds to the song's aggression and atmosphere.
**Before (split across sentences):**
> This does not mean every choice is equal. It means there is no external system that confirms which choice is right.
**After:**
> No external system confirms which choice is right.
**Before (clipped tail):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.
**After:**
> The options come from the selected item, so no one has to guess.

## 2. One-line closers and dramatic fragments

**Source:** [blader/humanizer] (no Wikipedia counterpart)

**Watch for:** a one-sentence paragraph that restates the paragraph before it; "That is the real win."; "Read that again."; "Let that sink in."; the same closer after several sections; a row of fragments ("No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia."); one word in ALL CAPS or with periods between words (every. single. day.).
**Problem:** The line asks the reader to pause on a claim instead of adding to it. One short sentence can carry emphasis when it carries a new fact. Cut a closer that repeats. Merge a row of fragments into a sentence with a specific claim.
**Before:**
> Then AlphaEvolve arrived. It had no preference for symmetry. No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia for human taste. The old rules were gone.
**After:**
> When AlphaEvolve arrived, the old rules stopped applying: it had no preference for symmetry or for human taste.
**Before (repeated closer):**
> Caching cuts repeat work.
>
> That is the real win.
>
> Retries hide brief outages.
>
> That is the real win.
**After:**
> Caching cuts repeat work.
>
> Retries hide brief outages.

## 3. Sayings that sound deep

**Source:** [blader/humanizer] (no Wikipedia counterpart)

**Watch for:** the real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter, X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of
**Problem:** An ordinary point is dressed as a hidden truth or an aphorism, and the dressing adds no detail. Replace the saying with the specific claim.
**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.
**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready.
**Before (aphorism):**
> Symmetry is the language of trust: users find symmetric layouts more predictable. Efficiency becomes a trap when teams forget the human layer and optimize workflows without watching how people use them.
**After:**
> Users find symmetric layouts more predictable. Optimizing workflows without watching how people use them backfires.

## 4. Staged run-up before the point

**Source:** [blader/humanizer] (no Wikipedia counterpart)

**Watch for:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, and casual versions such as "one thing that bit me, so pay attention"
**Problem:** The writer announces the point or stages a moment of candor instead of making the point. Remove the run-up, not just its tone. "Honestly" or "look" inside a casual sentence is ordinary; the tell is the standalone opener before a routine claim.
**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know. Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.
**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.
**Before (staged candor):**
> Is it worth the price? Honestly? It depends on how often you'll use it.
**After:**
> Whether it's worth the price depends on how often you'll use it.

## 5. Arguing with no one

**Source:** [blader/humanizer] (no Wikipedia counterpart)

**Watch for:** This isn't (mainly) about, I'm not saying, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, Some might say... but, A tempting approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just
**Problem:** The text answers an objection or rejects an option that appears nowhere else, usually a leftover from an earlier draft. Remove the defense; if it holds a real claim, state the claim. Keep an objection the text attributes or answers in full, and keep an option a reader would actually weigh. Several unrelated rejections in a row are a stronger sign than one.
**Before:**
> This isn't mainly about prompt length, and I'm not arguing that documentation doesn't matter. You could categorize the problem another way, but the issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.
**After:**
> The issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.
**Before (fake alternative):**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours. A tempting approach would be to rotate them by restarting the auth service on a cron job, but that would drop every active session. Rotation happens in place, and clients refresh transparently.
**After:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours, in place, and clients refresh transparently.
